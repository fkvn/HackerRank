/**
 * Given two strings of lower-case English letters,  and , perform the following operations:
   
   		1. Sum the lengths of A and B.
		2. Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
		3. Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
		
	Input Format
		The first line contains a string A. 
		The second line contains another string B. 
		The strings are comprised of only lower-case English letters.
	
	Output Format
		There are three lines of output: 
			For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B. 
			For the second line, write Yes if  is lexicographically greater than  otherwise print No instead. 
			For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
